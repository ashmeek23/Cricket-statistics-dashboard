# Cricket-statistics-dashboard
This aims to provide insights into cricket statistics. Web scraping is used to extract cricket data from sources such as ESPN Cricinfo. Python will be employed for data manipulation &amp; analysis, and the Pandas library for processing the data. The final step is visualizing the analyzed data through Power BI.
